## Bike Activity on the Fremont Bridge

### Visualization
- Visualization shows records of cyclist counts across the Fremont Bridge.
- Records from each calendar day are mapped to two lines on the visualization showing northbound and southbound counts at each hour.
- Sliding brushes allow the viewer to select a subset of daily records according to specific values of the following:
  - Max temperature
  - Daily precipitation
  - Day of the year
- Viewers can choose between weekdays/weekends through use of a radio button.
- Visualization reports number of days currently shown in gray area beneath the bank of controls.
- Emphasized lines show hourly counts for all days in the viz aggregated by date for each direction of cyclist traffic.
- Hovering over a non-aggregate line displays the day's date, maximum temperature, and amount of precipitation
 
(Put your a brief description of your final interactive visualization application and your dataset here.)


## Running Instructions

Put your running instructions here. (Tell us how to run your visualization.) 

If your visualization is web-based,  it would be great if your submission can be opened online. [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) is a good and easy way to put your visualization online so you can put your link here.  For example:

Access our visualization at [http://cse512-15s.github.io/a3-nkullman-gclenagh/](http://cse512-15s.github.io/a3-nkullman-gclenagh/) or download this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` and access this from http://localhost:9000/.

## Story Board

Put either your storyboard content or a [link to your storyboard pdf file](storyboard.pdf?raw=true) here. Just like A2, you can use any software to create a *reasonable* pdf storyboard.


### Changes between Storyboard and the Final Implementation

A paragraph explaining changes between the storyboard and the final implementation.


## Development Process

Include:
- Breakdown of how the work was split among the group members. 
- A commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: 
  - Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application?
  - What aspects took the most time?
